In this problem the Iris Plants Database contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of Iris plant. The attributes/features were extended by two features for each plant instance for a total of 6 features. The updated data is provide as a csv file. In this assignment data processing and machine learning techniques need to be implemented as follows:

<ol>

 <li>Data Cleansing (use the iris data for cleansing.csv)</li>

 <li>Data Transformation (can be combined with #6 (dimensionality reduction))</li>

 <li>Generate two sets of features from the original 4 features to end up with a total of 8 featres</li>

 <li>Perform Feature Preprocessing</li>

</ol>

Use an outlier removal method to remove any outliers.

<ol start="5">

 <li>Rank the 6 set of features to determine which are the two top features</li>

 <li>Reduce the dimensionality to two features using PCA or Kernel PCA</li>

 <li>Using the following Machine Learning techniques, classify the three class Iris data:

  <ul>

   <li>Expectation Maximization</li>

   <li>Either Fisher Linear Discriminant (Linear Discriminant Analysis), Kernel Fisherâ€™s Discriminant or Parzen Window</li>

   <li>Neural Network Method (Probabilistic NN, Radial Basis Function or Feed Forward) (d) Support Vector Machine</li>

  </ul></li>
